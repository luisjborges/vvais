            <p> Manuel was born and raised in Cuman√° and it has been his home for the last twenty-five years. Manuel confessed to us that in the 5th.
              semester of his university, he was unable to pursue higher education for two reasons: 1) Cost to get to University. 2) High level of
              insecurity. Manuel told us: <i> ‚Äú<u> Continuing in University meant my life or a degree? With all the pain in my heart I decided not
              to continue anymore</u>‚Äù.</i>
            </p>
            <p> Manuel enjoys drawing and playing the guitar and is a person who likes to be constantly learning. Manuel's entertainment is watching
            ‚ÄòPopular Science‚Äô and he is good at Physics and Mathematics. He also likes to read about personal growth. An insight he got from his most
            recent readings is:<i> "<u> -if you want something from the world, you have to offer something to the world back- </u>".</i> </p>
            <p> Manuel told us that one of his strengths is his ability to ‚Äúsolve problems‚Äù and he was very excited to apply for SINA because:
            <i>‚Äú<u> When I read the website it was like a calling: -if you are looking for a sign of the universe, this is your sign-. It was a
            magical moment that made me feel like I was already part of it. ‚Äù</u> </p> </i>
            <p> Manuel's dream is to be the owner of a business and to be an Entrepreneur:<i>"<u> I'm always thinking of ideas, they don't turn out
            to be successful but hey... That constant attempt at some point has to work.‚Äù</p> </u></i>
            <br>
            <h3> Words from Manuel upon being selected as a VVAISxSINA scholar: </h3>
            <br>
            <i><h5>"‚Ä¶ Being selected for this great project makes me feel very lucky, this feels like the beginning of something
            very big, at this moment I think that neither I nor anyone else can elucidate the impact that this first step will have on my life and the life of
            many other people. But if there is something I am sure of, it is that I will give everything so that this has the widest possible scope. I just hope I can get him out
            the greatest benefit from this experience, to become a person capable of doing exceptional things, in order to change my reality and
            reality of others who, like me, have a lot of potential that at this moment is not being used to the maximum ... "</h5></i>
