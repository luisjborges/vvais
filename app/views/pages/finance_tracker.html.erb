      <h4>Background</h4>
      <br>
      <div class="blog-text">
        <p>
          On the 24th. of July 2020, birthday of Venezuelan Liberator Sim√≥n Bolivar, we kicked off this purpose-driven project called VVAIS to
          give back to the country that has given me everything I have today: a family, an education, a career and a company. The Venezuelan
          Social Innovation Academy is the first step towards bringing entrepreneurial education and empowerment to million of young people striving
          to make a living in Venezuela and represents an alternative to thrive in a challenging environment through entrepreneurship.
          <br>
          <br>
          Back in July I was very ambitious in my aspirations. I set a goal to to raise <u><strong>20,000 ‚Ç¨</strong></u> to start this journey and
          finance the trip of 4 Venezuelans (2 scholars and 2 founders) traveling to SINA in Uganda but, this proved to be more challenging that expected.
          In the following paragraphs, I'd like to show the results of our first initial efforts, main challenges/learnings and next steps for vvais
          by the end of 2020 and starting 2021.
        </p>
      </div>
      <br>
      <h4>Results</h4>
      <br>
      <div class="blog-text">
        <p>
          <u><strong>We were not able to raise the planned amount of 20,000 ‚Ç¨.</strong></u> Raising money is a full-time job and we understimated the
          efforts, resources needed, the reach of our personal network  and the sensible metrics to raise twenty-thousand euros, namely: creating awareness, telling our story, building trust and
          ask for donations; a repeatable cycle in which we got better and better but insufficient for the goal we set.
        </p>
          <br>
          <h3>üíµ Total raised: 2,500‚Ç¨</h3>
          <h3>üë• Number of donors: 55</h3>
          <h3>‚àë Average donation: 45‚Ç¨</h3>
          <h3>üôåüèº Highest donation made: 150‚Ç¨</h3>
          <h3>üóì Days of campaign: 99 days</h3>
          <br>
          <p>
          This amount is mostly thanks to our friends, family, ex-colleagues, collaborators and closest network. To all of you, <strong>THANK YOU VERY MUCH!</strong>
          In general, the response and the sentiment for our project was perceived as positive but we also heard the challenges VVAIS will face in the future trying to
          bring a donation-based initiative forward and the additional barriers that represents the local Venezuelan and international environment nowadays.

      <h4>Main challenges</h4>
      <br>
      <div class="blog-text">
      <p>I'd like to briefly mention the main barriers we encountered in our campaign and project as a whole:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Campaign:</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Establish trust beyond our friends and family.</li>
              <li>Clear communication about vvais: benefits, scholars, partners, budget breakdown, strategy beyond the campaign.</li>
              <li>Available time for founders and collaborators to work on vvais in a part-time basis.</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li>VVAIS project:</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Local bureaucratic processes to issue passports and/or extensions to scholars.</li>
              <li>Uncertainty about flights and international trips due to COVID-19.</li>
              <li>Constantly communicating to donors progress and challenges encountered.</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <br>
      <h4>Learning:</h4>
      <br>
      <div class="blog-text">
        <ul>
          <li>Trust is paramount. We need to build it first to go beyond our friends and family network.</li>
          <li>VVAIS requires full-time attention. It is not possible to carry out this project on the side. More
          than 8 hours/week are required to pull it off.</li>
          <li>An initial goal of 20,000‚Ç¨ proved to be ambitious. Perhaps with more dedication and prioritization
          could have been achievable. In our current setup, it wasn't.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <br>
      <h4>Next Steps:</h4>
      <br>
      <div class="blog-text">
        <p>I'd like to briefly mention the main barriers we encountered in our campaign and project as a whole:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Get direct support from SINA Uganda</li>
          <li>Reduce budget to 5,000 EUR</li>
          <li>Raise remaining 2,500 EUR</li>
        </ul>
