      <h4 class="crowdfunding-title">Background</h4>
      <br>
      <p>On the 24th. of July 2020, was born this idea to give back to a country that have given me everything I have nowadays: a family,
        and education, a career and now a company. This idea is called VVAIS (Venezuelan Social Innovation Academy) and it represents the
        first step to bring entrepreneurial education, inspiration and empowerment to the million of young people striving to make a living
        in a tough country. <br><br>Back in July we were and still are very ambitious in our aspirations. We set ourselves to raise 20,000 EUR to start
        this journey with 4 Venezuelans coming to Uganda. This is a summary of our results.
